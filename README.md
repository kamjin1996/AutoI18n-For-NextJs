# Auto Internationalization For NextJs

**Auto Internationalization For NextJs** aims to provide an automatic internationalization solution for Next.js projects, saving you time and increasing development efficiency.

Our tool simplifies the internationalization process for **Next.js projects using AppRouter** and **continuously updating new pages**, helping users easily handle the internationalization of their projects.

The current version of AutoI18n For NextJs integrates **next-intl** as the basic internationalization library to handle the project's textual content.

## Features

- Support for configuring internationalization parameters through a visual interface, such as required languages, static rendering, default redirects, etc.
- One-click integration and updating of internationalization support for Next.js projects
- A dedicated editor for one-click editing and translation of already i18n-labeled content
- Preview integration effects, providing language dropdown or tiled switching components

## Installation

Download the latest version from the [Download](https://autoi18n.dev/download) page, then there's software installation and use.

## Usage

The tool interface is simple and intuitive. Configure it as needed, then submit and preview the effects. You can view the [docs](https://autoi18n.dev/docs)

## Limitations

Currently, AutoI18n mainly provides internationalization processing for project integration and page label text content levels. However, due to the complexity and continuous maintenance requirements of project internationalization, users may need to make personalized internationalization customizations according to the next-intl documentation. We will also provide more support in future updates.
